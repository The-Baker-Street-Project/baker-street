# Code Review Reports

This directory contains structured code review reports generated by the `/code-review` skill.

## How It Works

The code review system runs 5 specialist reviewers against your code:

1. **TypeScript Quality** — Strict mode, type safety, import hygiene
2. **API/Service Patterns** — Framework conventions, validation, service layer patterns
3. **UI/Design Compliance** — Design tokens, icons, accessibility, component states
4. **Security** — Input validation, secrets, auth middleware, injection prevention
5. **Test Quality** — Coverage gaps, behavior testing, edge cases

Each specialist produces structured findings with:
- **Severity**: Blocker, High, Medium, Low, Info
- **Confidence**: 0.50 - 1.00 (higher = more certain)
- **Evidence**: Code snippets showing the issue
- **Recommendation**: Concrete fix instructions

## Running a Review

```bash
# Review files changed since main branch
/code-review

# Review a specific package
/code-review --scope=package --target=packages/api

# Review all of a team's packages
/code-review --scope=team --target=team-1

# Deep review of a single file
/code-review --scope=file --target=src/services/auth.service.ts
```

## Verdicts

- **PASS**: No Blockers, no High-severity findings. Ready to merge.
- **WARN**: No Blockers, but has High-severity findings. Merge allowed with noted issues.
- **FAIL**: Has Blocker-severity findings. Must fix before merge.

## Report Format

Reports are saved as markdown files in this directory with naming convention:
`{YYYY-MM-DD}-{scope}-{target}.md`

## Integration with Gates

The Verifier agent runs `/code-review` at gate checkpoints defined in `.code-review/config.json` or as appropriate for the project's development workflow.
